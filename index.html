            <h1>The Panama Canal</h1>
            <h6><b>Fast Definition:</b></h6>
            <h6>A canal (small river) made in Panama to give shipping freights a way to cut through latin america. It skips the long trip around South America.</h6>
						<br>
						<h1>The beginning of the canal</h1>
						<p>The French first attempted at building the canal. 9 years and 20,000 people later, the attempt stopped. But, the US still wanted to build the canal.</p>
						<p>President Teddy Rosevelt dispatched warships to Panama city. They fought for Panamanian independence against Colombia. Panama declared independence November 3, 1903.</p>
						<p>The US paid Panama $10 million and a annual annunity payment of $250,000 for a 10 mile wide strip of land in Panama.</p>
						<h1>The building of the canal</h1>
						<p>Beginning in 1907, US citizens blasted through mountain. It was a hot climate, but the threat of yellow fever and malaria was diminished by Walter Reed and William Gorgas.</p>
						<p>In 1914, the US finished building the canal at a approximate cost of $345 million.</p>
						<h1>The effect of the canal today</h1>
						<p>The canal, although built more than 100 years ago, still accounts for 10% of all US shipping.</p>
						<p>If something were to happen to the canal, there would be a slow down in goods traded between countries</p>
						<p>But, newer ships might not be able to cross the canal in 50 or so years. The size of the locks in the canal are only so big to fit ships. </p>
